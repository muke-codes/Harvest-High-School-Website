# Harvest-High-School-Website
A responsive, multi-page website built for my former high school to showcase its history, core values, academics, events, and contact information. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project includes a clean layout, mobile-friendly design, and interactive features like an image gallery and contact form validation.
