# Harvest-High-School-Website
A responsive, multi-page website built for my former high school to showcase its history, core values, academics, events, and contact information. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project includes a clean layout, mobile-friendly design, and interactive features like an image gallery and contact form validation.

This project is a fully responsive website created for my former high school to provide a centralized online presence for students, parents, and staff. The site highlights the schoolâ€™s core values, academic programs, history, and contact details. It also features an interactive image gallery and a contact form with client-side validation.

Technologies used:

HTML5 for structure and semantic markup

CSS3 for styling and responsive design

JavaScript for interactivity (image slider, form validation)

Features:

Mobile-friendly responsive layout

Easy navigation with a sticky header

Image gallery showcasing school events

Contact form with input validation

This project helped me practice front-end development skills and create a meaningful website that could benefit the school community.
